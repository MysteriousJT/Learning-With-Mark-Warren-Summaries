# Fix Your Eyesight: Improve Your Vision Naturally with One Lesson

## Mark Warren's Vision Journey

Mark Warren explains why he started his vision journey. He describes the constant pain in his eyes when working on his computer for long periods. Later, he realizes that when he wakes up in the middle of the night, he can see his alarm clock crystal clear. This intrigued him to research how to improve his eyesight.

### Key Points
- **Vision and Mental Mind**: Mark states that about 80% of our vision loss is mental, while the other 20% relates to glasses.
- **Peripheral Vision**: Myopia or nearsightedness blocks our brain's ability to use the external peripheral vision.
- **Triangulation**: This method involves noticing the depth in distances between objects to clear up the central vision.

## Fast Vision Restoration: Active Focus and Bates Method

Mark realizes that both Active Focus and Bates methods lead to the same point in vision improvement. To improve our vision, we must be aware of at least two objects around us simultaneously.

### Eye Movement Types
1. **Stationary Movement**: Move your head while keeping your eyes on the foreground and background.
2. **Mobile Movement**: Notice objects converging and diverging during physical motion (e.g., walking, running).
3. **Object Movement**: Track a moving object while noticing another object in your peripheral vision.

## Why Active Focus and Bates Method Swinging Are Similar

Swinging is a key technique in both Active Focus and Bates methods.

### Active Focus Technique
1. **Object or Paper with Text**: Move forward until the text is clear, then move back to the edge of blur.
2. **Blink and Clear**: Blink a few times to clear the text.
3. **Peripheral Focus**: Place an object in front of the paper and focus on outside objects.

### Mobile Movement Technique
1. **Rock Side to Side**: Focus on the movement behind and in front of the object.
2. **Repeat**: Perform the rocking motion for 4-5 rounds.

## Fast Vision Correction Results

Focusing on distant objects can relax your clarity muscles. Over time, this helps to reduce stinging and tearing. Regular training of your eye muscles will make them stronger.

## Addressing Myopia

Noticing movement in your peripheral vision helps keep your central vision sharp. People with perfect vision can notice many objects in their peripheral vision while focusing on movement.

## FAQs

### Can I Do This Without Glasses?
Yes, but you need a lower prescription to focus on slight blur. Notice your peripheral vision and movements between objects.

### How Long Should I Do the Eye Techniques?
These are not exercises but techniques to build into a habit. Practice from the time you wake up until you go to bed.

### What About Double Vision?
Double vision will improve with mobile movement techniques and awareness of converging and diverging objects.

### Should I Patch?
Patching can strain your muscles. Instead, use the edge of blur technique and rocking methods.

### Should I Blink?
Try not to blink during the rocking technique to help weak muscles release.

### Is Tearing a Contact Lens Effect?
No, tearing comes from the release of the ciliary muscle.

### How Are You Rocking?
Move your whole body as one, rocking from your feet or waist.

### I Don't See Any Progress?
Consistency and patience are key. Keep practicing good habits and visual techniques.

### How Long Will This Take?
The process requires time, consistency, and patience. The more you practice, the faster the results.

### What About Axial Elongation?
The ciliary muscle can focus the lens despite axial elongation. Peripheral vision and motion tracking drills help strengthen the muscle.

### Where's Your Science?
Vision restoration is about training and exercising the eye muscles, despite what traditional science may say.

## Bad Vision Habits

### Avoid:
- Tunnel vision
- Reading without moving your eyes
- Walking without focusing on objects
- Watching TV or reading with headrests
- Not getting enough daylight
- Doubting your ability to improve your vision
- Believing others who say you can't improve your vision
- Impatience
